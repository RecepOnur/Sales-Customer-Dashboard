# Sales-Customer-Dashboard
This dashboard shows the details about US sales in different categories. I use sales, profit, and quantity for KPIs. Also I identify the salea and profit by subgcategory and sales over time. In the second page of dashboard you can see information about customers. The dashboard is interactive and informative.
